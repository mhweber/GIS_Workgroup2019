My part of GIS Workgroup talk
- Overview of how we use GeoPandas, Rasterio, Numpy in work in branch
- Go over basic tasks we use GeoPandas, Rasterio for
- Intro to GeoPandas, Rasterio
- Introduce idea of splitcat watersheds, how it fits into streamcat
- Advantages of these tools:
    - Reproducible, open source workflow
    - everything can be done in memory, no intermediate rasters and files need to be produced!
    - rasterio allows windowed targeted reads to only bring in cells needed in memory!
